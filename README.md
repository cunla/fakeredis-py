# Intro

FakeRedis is a pure-Python implementation of the Redis key-value store.

It enables running tests requiring redis server without an actual server.

It provides enhanced versions of the redis-py Python bindings for Redis. That provide the following added functionality:
A built-in Redis server that is automatically installed, configured and managed when the Redis bindings are used. A
single server shared by multiple programs or multiple independent servers. All the servers provided by
FakeRedis support all Redis functionality including advanced features such as RedisJson, GeoCommands.

See [official documentation](https://fakeredis.readthedocs.io/) for list of supported commands.
